# **Image Style Transfer with CycleGAN**
This file is a deep learning project that uses the CycleGAN algorithm to perform image style transfer. In the project, the horse2zebra dataset is used to transform horse images into zebra images and zebra images into horse images. The CycleGAN model utilizes two neural networks to perform bi-directional translation; one transforms horses into zebras, and the other transforms zebras into horses. During this process, style transfer is achieved through unsupervised learning, and the model does not require any paired datasets. This project is a group assignment.
